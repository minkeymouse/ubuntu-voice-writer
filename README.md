# Ubuntu Voice Writer

A simple, browser-based voice dictation tool that types where your cursor is.

## Features

- üé§ **Real-time speech recognition** using your browser's built-in API
- ‚å®Ô∏è **Automatic typing** into any application where your cursor is
- üåê **Browser-based** - works in remote desktop environments
- üöÄ **Fast and reliable** - optimized typing methods
- üéØ **Simple interface** - just Start, Stop, and Quit buttons
- ‚ö° **Lightweight** - no complex dependencies, just system tools

## Installation

```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt install xdotool xclip

# Run the installation script
./install.sh
```

## Usage

### Start VoiceWriter
```bash
./launch.sh
```

Or click the desktop icon!

### How to use
1. **Start** the application (desktop icon or terminal)
2. **Allow microphone access** when prompted
3. **Click "Start Dictation"** to begin recording
4. **Speak clearly** - your speech will be typed automatically
5. **Click "Stop"** to pause dictation
6. **Close the browser tab** or click "Quit" to close the application

## How it works

- Uses your browser's Web Speech API (same as Google Voice Typing)
- Sends transcribed text to a Python server
- Python processes text to add punctuation and formatting
- Types processed text using `xdotool` where your cursor is located
- Works in any application (text editors, browsers, terminals, etc.)

## Requirements

- Ubuntu/Linux with desktop environment
- Python 3.6+ (standard library only)
- Chrome or Edge browser
- `xdotool` and `xclip` packages

## Troubleshooting

**Speech recognition not working?**
- Make sure you're using Chrome or Edge
- Allow microphone access when prompted
- Check that your microphone is working

**Typing not working?**
- Make sure `xdotool` and `xclip` are installed
- Try clicking where you want to type first
- Check that the target application accepts text input

**Server won't start?**
- Check if port 8000 is already in use
- Try running `./stop.py` to stop any existing servers
