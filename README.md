## Configuration

The application can be customized by editing `config.json`:

```json
{
  "server": {
    "port": 8000,
    "host": "localhost"
  },
  "typing": {
    "timeout": 1.5,
    "batch_size": 10,
    "delay": 0.005
  },
  "browser": {
    "preferred": "chrome",
    "fallback": "firefox"
  },
  "speech": {
    "language": "en-US",
    "continuous": true,
    "interim_results": true
  }
}
```

## How it works

- Uses your browser's Web Speech API (same as Google Voice Typing)
- Sends transcribed text to a Python server
- Python processes text to add punctuation and formatting
- Types processed text using `xdotool` where your cursor is located
- Works in any application (text editors, browsers, terminals, etc.)

## Requirements

- Ubuntu/Linux with desktop environment
- Python 3.6+ (standard library only)
- Chrome or Edge browser
- `xdotool` and `xclip` packages

## Troubleshooting

**Speech recognition not working?**
- Make sure you're using Chrome or Edge
- Allow microphone access when prompted
- Check that your microphone is working

**Typing not working?**
- Make sure `xdotool` and `xclip` are installed
- Try clicking where you want to type first
- Check that the target application accepts text input

**Server won't start?**
- Check if port 8000 is already in use
- Try running `./stop.py` to stop any existing servers

**Desktop icon not working?**
- Run `./install.sh` again to fix desktop integration
- Check that the icon file exists in the icons directory
